Hi there 👋 I’m Reni, a Senior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. I’m currently a Software Engineering intern at Dow Jones, where I’ve been working on writing backend tests, debugging production systems, and shipping features on a .NET and React-based oil supply chain platform.

Before this, I worked with NOAA to visualize precipitation data and evaluate ML forecast models, and at SIRJ Lab I helped build dashboards using 3+ years of stormwater sensor data on GCP. I’m especially interested in the intersection of data systems and real-world messiness — anything that involves tracing problems end-to-end, understanding how users interact with data, and making systems actually work.

👩‍💻 Interests

**Software Engineering** — Developing server-side architectures, API design, and automated testing

**ML & LLMs** — Experience with foundation models (OpenAI, TinyLlama), recommender systems, and predictive modeling

**Data science** — Statistical analysis, A/B testing, experiment design, and model performance evaluation

**Cloud infrastructure** — AWS, GCP, Databricks

🔭 Currently at

**Dow Jones** – Debugging and writing code in a large enterprise system built with React, Node.js, C#, and SQL Server

**NOAA** – Built dashboards to evaluate ML-based precipitation forecasts

**SIRJ Lab** – Analyzed real-time water sensor data using BigQuery and GCP tools

💬 Outside of work, I like:

Long walks with music or a podcast

Trying new cafes or food places with friends

Exploring new technologies, particularly in the LLM space
